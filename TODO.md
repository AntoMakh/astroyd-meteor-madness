# Simulation Endpoint Bug Fixes - Completed

## Issues Fixed

- [x] Fixed KeyError in \_calculate_impact_zones: Changed `impact_data["blast"]` to `impact_data["blast_radius"]`
- [x] Added damage_assessment field to SimulationResponse model
- [x] Included damage_assessment in the simulation response creation
- [x] Fixed user_id handling in database save to prevent AttributeError when current_user is None
- [x] Added logging configuration to main.py to ensure application logs are displayed
- [x] Added logging to /history endpoint to log access and number of simulations retrieved

## Tests Status

- [x] test_simulate_endpoint_basic: PASSED
- [x] test_simulate_endpoint_with_ml: PASSED

## Summary

The POST /api/v1/simulation/simulate endpoint was returning 500 Internal Server Error due to:

1. A KeyError when accessing 'blast' instead of 'blast_radius' in impact data
2. Missing damage_assessment field in the response model and response creation
3. Database save failure due to user_id access on None object

All issues have been resolved and both test cases now pass successfully.

Additionally, logging has been added to the GET /api/v1/simulation/history endpoint to ensure access is logged.
